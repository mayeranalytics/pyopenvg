Though the code generally works, it is still incomplete. In particular, the following functions have not yet been wrapped:
vgMask

vgRemovePathCapabilities
vgModifyPathCoords
vgTransformPath
vgInterpolatePath
vgPathLength
vgPointAlongPath

vgSetColor
vgGetColor

vgImageSubData
vgGetImageSubData
vgWritePixels
vgReadPixels
vgColorMatrix
vgConvolve
vgSeparableConvolve
vgGaussianBlur
vgLookup
vgLookupSingle

vgHardwareQuery
vgGetString

vguComputeWarpQuadToSquare
vguComputeWarpSquareToQuad
vguComputeWarpQuadToQuad

Additionally, the code is currently dependent on Ivan Leben's ShivaVG implementation to take care of managing the context as EGL support on Windows is lacking.
vgGetPaint is not implemented in the current release of ShivaVG, so it is currently commented out.
