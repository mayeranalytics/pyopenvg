8/7/09:
Added support for AmanithVG (no extensions)! This means a major overhaul of the base code, so it might be a bit buggy. Right now, it will look for AmanithVG, and then try to fallback to ShivaVG.

Ditching build_shiva.py - it was pretty hacky anyways. Instead, you can deal with the hacky setup.py. Now, extensions are broken down into three separate commands - build_shiva, build_amanith, and build_freetype. It shouldn't be necessary to mess with setup.py anymore. Instead, the local stuff is in setup.cfg. At least on windows, if you've built all the dependencies from source and point it at the correct directories, it should build just fine.

I drastically changed the internal structure of the svg module. The bad news is that if you were directly accessing any attributes, it probably won't work anymore. The good news is that I added support for gradients.
The main difference is that you no longer have to import ElementTree and feed it an element, because it now subclasses ElementTree.ElementTree and ElementTree.Element. Instead of parsing the file yourself, just pass the path to svg.parse_svg

If you have any trouble compiling this stuff, feel free to shoot me an email.
I know that my build system is totally weird.

New features in this first tagged release:
FreeType font support - PyOpenVG now uses FreeType2 to read outline data so that you can render text via OpenVG.font
Some image support - Still buggy, not helped by the removal of my test computer's graphics card.
Limited SVG support - just enough to render groups and paths with colors, not necessarily translated correctly (viewboxes are a pain, seriously)

Sometime in September 2008:
Though the code generally works, it is still incomplete. In particular, the following functions have not yet been wrapped:
vgMask

vgSetColor
vgGetColor

vgColorMatrix
vgConvolve
vgSeparableConvolve
vgGaussianBlur
vgLookup
vgLookupSingle

vgHardwareQuery
vgGetString


Additionally, the code is currently dependent on Ivan Leben's ShivaVG implementation to take care of managing the context as EGL support on Windows is lacking.
Image support is still lacking, but otherwise the code is mostly functional.
