Though the code generally works, it is still incomplete. In particular, the following functions have not yet been wrapped:
vgMask

vgSetColor
vgGetColor

vgImageSubData
vgGetImageSubData
vgWritePixels
vgReadPixels
vgColorMatrix
vgConvolve
vgSeparableConvolve
vgGaussianBlur
vgLookup
vgLookupSingle

vgHardwareQuery
vgGetString


Additionally, the code is currently dependent on Ivan Leben's ShivaVG implementation to take care of managing the context as EGL support on Windows is lacking.
Image support is still lacking, but otherwise the code is mostly functional.
