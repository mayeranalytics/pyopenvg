..  currentmodule:: VG

===============
OpenVG Contexts
===============
..  class:: Context(dimensions)

    Context objects represent EGL contexts, which store settings pertaining
    to transforming, filtering, stroking, and filling operations as well as
    details of the drawing surface. 

    With ShivaVG and AmanithVG, there is no means to specify an EGL context
    to bind to; instead they provide their own internal context-like objects.
    Accordingly, at this moment, there can only be one context at a time. The
    Context class is a singleton.

    Context objects must be created before any OpenVG functions or classes can
    be instantiated, except for :class:`Style` objects. A context can be instantiated
    only after there is an OpenGL surface for OpenVG to bind to.

    All functions of the OpenVG.VG module are mirrored as staticmethods on context
    objects.

    ..  method:: resize(dimensions)

        Resizes the OpenVG context

    ..  method:: destroy()

        Destroys the OpenVG context


..  function:: create_context(dimensions)

    Creates and returns a context of the specified dimensions
    It is not necessary to hold a reference to the created context.

..  function:: resize_context(dimensions)

    Resizes the current context

..  function:: destroy_context()

    Destroys the current context; this will automatically be done when
    the program terminates and the context object is garbage-collected


Getting/Setting Parameters
==========================

Context parameters (such as stroke width, dashing, scissoring, etc) are
accessed through the :func:`get` and :func:`set` functions. These functions
abstract away the details of remembering whether the parameter is a float or
an int or how many parameters it's supposed to return.

..  note::

    :func:`get` and :func:`set` are *not* included in ``__all__``, so they cannot
    be imported using ``from OpenVG.VG import *``


..  function:: get(param_type)

    Given a param from the VGParamType enumeration, this returns the corresponding
    context parameter. See the `specification and header file <http://khronos.org/openvg/>`_
    for a full list of context parameters, their behaviors, and default values.

    Usage::

        color = VG.get(VG_CLEAR_COLOR)

..  function:: set(param_type, value) 

    Given a param from the VGParamType enumeration, this sets the corresponding
    context parameter to value.

    Usage::

        VG.set(VG_STROKE_DASH_PATTERN, (5, 10))

Getting/Setting Paint
---------------------
In OpenVG, filling and stroking is abstracted into Paint objects, which represent
a means of coloring a surface. Each paint object stores the information needed to
paint a surface (color, gradient stops, etc). A paint mode can be associated with
stroking, filling, or both.

..  function:: get_paint(mode)

    :param mode: the paint mode requested (which must be either :const:`VG_STROKE_PATH` or :const:`VG_FILL_PATH`)
    :returns: the current paint or None if no paint has been set for that mode.

..  function:: set_paint(paint, mode)

    Sets the paint for mode (which must be :const:`VG_STROKE_PATH`, :const:`VG_FILL_PATH`,
    or the result of bitwise ORing them together) to paint. If paint is None,
    then the default paint is set (opaque black).

Querying OpenVG properties
--------------------------
OpenVG exposes implementation-specific information such as the vendor, version,
renderer, and extensions through the vgGetString function.

..  function:: get_string(string_id)

    :param string_id: an enum corresponding to the string requested. Valid values include :const:`VG_VENDOR`, :const:`VG_RENDERER`, :const:`VG_VERSION`, and :const:`VG_EXTENSIONS`. This may not be called before the context has been created.

    :returns: the corresponding string information. 



Graphics Functions
==================

..  function:: clear(corner, dimensions[, color=None])

    Clears the area from corner (the bottom left corner) with the dimensions
    supplied. If color is not None, then that RGBA 4-tuple is used as the clear
    color. Otherwise the screen is cleared using :term:`VG_CLEAR_COLOR`.

..  function:: flush()

    Tells OpenVG to hurry up and complete all pending drawing requests, but does
    not guarantee that all pending requests will be completed immediately

..  function:: finish()

    Tells OpenVG to block until all pending drawing requests are complete.

Transformations
===============

Matrix Manipulation
-------------------

OpenVG matrices are of the form::

    sx  shx tx
    shy sy  ty
    w0  w1  w2

which is represented by a flat list of the form::

    [sx, shy, w0, shx, sy, w1, tx, ty, w2]

OpenVG keeps track of four transformation matrices:

    :const:`VG_MATRIX_PATH_USER_TO_SURFACE`
        applied to paths before drawing them

    :const:`VG_MATRIX_IMAGE_USER_TO_SURFACE`
        applied to images before drawing them

    :const:`VG_MATRIX_FILL_PAINT_TO_USER`
        applied to the fill paint when drawing

    :const:`VG_MATRIX_STROKE_PAINT_TO_USER`
        applied to the stroke paint when drawing

The matrix mode can be set using ``VG.set(VG_MATRIX_MODE, mode)``

The default matrix mode is :const:`VG_MATRIX_PATH_USER_TO_SURFACE`, which is
probably the mode you want.

..  function:: get_matrix()

    :returns: the flattened 3x3 transformation matrix for the current matrix mode.

..  function:: load_matrix(M)

    :param M: a 9-element tuple corresponding to a transformation matrix (affine
        matrices must be padded.)

    loads the matrix M as the matrix for the current matrix mode.                                         

..  function:: load_identity()

    loads the identity matrix as the transformation matrix for the current
    matrix mode.

..  function:: mult_matrix(M)

    multiplies the current transformation matrix by M.

General Transformation Functions
--------------------------------

..  function:: translate(tx, ty)

    applies a translation by (tx, ty) pixels to the current transform matrix

..  function:: scale(sx, sy)

    applies a scale by sx in the x direction and sy in the y direction to the
    current transform matrix

..  function:: rotate(angle)

    :param angle: the angle in degrees to rotate by

    applies a rotation by angle degrees to the current transform matrix

..  function:: shear(shx, shy)

    applies a shear by shx and shy to the current transform matrix
