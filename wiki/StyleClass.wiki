#summary An explanation of how to use Style objects

= Introduction =

Style objects take care of storing, setting, and restoring the OpenVG context parameters related to styling and drawing. For example, this code:

{{{
    #Save old settings
    old_paint = VG.get_paint(VG_STROKE_PATH)
    old_stroke_width = VG.get(VG_STROKE_LINE_WIDTH)

    #Set current settings
    VG.set_paint(stroke_paint, VG_STROKE_PATH)
    VG.set(VG_STROKE_LINE_WIDTH, 5.0)
    
    #Draw
    path.draw(VG_STROKE_PATH)

    #Restore old settings
    VG.set_paint(old_paint, VG_STROKE_PATH)
    VG.set(VG_STROKE_LINE_WIDTH, old_stroke_width)
}}}

becomes

{{{
    #Create style object
    style = VG.Style(stroke_paint=stroke_paint, VG_STROKE_LINE_WIDTH=5.0)
    
    #Set current settings
    style.enable()
    
    #Draw
    path.draw(VG_STROKE_PATH)

    #Restore old settings
    style.disable()
}}}
Style objects are also context managers, allowing you to use the with statement introduced in Python 2.6:

{{{ 
    style = VG.Style(stroke_paint=stroke_paint, VG_STROKE_LINE_WIDTH=5.0)
    with style:
        path.draw(VG_STROKE_PATH)
}}}    
For one-off things, you can also pass a style parameter to path.draw

{{{
    style = VG.Style(stroke_paint=stroke_paint, VG_STROKE_LINE_WIDTH=5.0)
    path.draw(VG_STROKE_PATH, style=style)
}}}

= Caveats =

Although get_paint and set_paint usually use None to signify that the default paint is being used or set, Style objects will *not* set the paint to the default if None is passed in.
